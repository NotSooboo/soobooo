      <h3>Bloxy Battle Royale</h3>
      <p>My Game Bloxy Battle Royale is a battle royale shooter game where you can build, loot up, and play against others! <br>
	  The main point of my game is to be the last one standing and eliminate other opponents using guns or by building! <br>
	  NOTE: I made this game when I was 10 which was such a long time ago... and A very long time ago I tried to add a really nice gui system which I made but forgot to scale each and every single GUI
	  <br> so I tried to do it but it was a big hassle so I left the game forever, And never updated it to this day...</p>

      <h3>Ro-Mine</h3>
      <p>Ro-Mine is a game, where you mine blocks and place blocks! You can craft and build homes, explore caves and more! (influenced my minecraft)<br>
	  It works perfectly, but I scrapped the game because there are not many people that are playing the game which lead my scripts being outdated!</p>
